# Surah An-Naba ASR Evaluation

This repository contains Python code to evaluate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on the recitations of Surah An-Naba, using different reciters. It calculates the Word Error Rate (WER) for each reciter and provides an average WER across all reciters.

## Overview

- The evaluation uses Surah An-Naba recitations by 6 different reciters.
- Each reciter has 40 audio files, corresponding to the 40 verses of Surah An-Naba.
- Several ASR models are tested and compared on these recitations.
- The Word Error Rate (WER) for each reciter is calculated, along with the average WER for all reciters.
